# üé® VGA Paint Tool using Nexys A7 FPGA

This project is a **fully interactive VGA Paint Tool** built using the **Nexys A7 FPGA development board (Artix-7)**. It allows users to draw colored pixels on a VGA screen in real-time using switches to choose colors and buttons to move a pixel-shaped cursor. An additional eraser mode lets users remove parts of their drawing.

Designed in **Verilog HDL**, this project interfaces directly with a VGA monitor and implements basic graphics using pixel memory logic and screen refresh via a VGA controller.

## üß† Project Summary

- **Platform**: Nexys A7 FPGA Board (Artix-7)
- **Language**: Verilog HDL
- **Output Display**: VGA Monitor
- **Inputs**:
  - 16 switches for selecting pixel color
  - 4 directional buttons for moving the cursor (Up, Down, Left, Right)
  - 1 pushbutton to toggle **Eraser Mode**
- **Core Modules**:
  - VGA controller
  - Cursor logic
  - Color selection
  - Frame buffer (pixel memory)

## üîå Hardware Setup

This is the physical setup of the project. The VGA cable connects the Nexys A7 board to a monitor, while switches and buttons on the board control painting actions.

‚û°Ô∏è **Notable Features Used**:
- 16 DIP Switches to select the color (mapped to 4-bit or 5-bit color)
- Onboard buttons for movement (cursor control)
- A pushbutton to toggle erasing
- VGA port for output

‚û°Ô∏è **What's visible**:
- Drawn pixels in different colors
- Real-time response to user input
- Clean screen refresh handled by the VGA controller

## üß© Features Breakdown

- üé® **16-Color Palette**: Choose from 16 different colors using the switches on the FPGA.
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è **Cursor Movement**: Navigate across the screen using directional buttons.
- üßº **Eraser Mode**: Use a button to enable eraser mode ‚Äî any drawn pixels will be removed when the cursor moves over them.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Real-time VGA Output**: Paint updates are reflected instantly on the VGA screen using accurate sync signals.
- üíæ **Pixel Buffer**: A simple memory system stores which pixels are active and their colors.

| File                     | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `paint_tool.v`           | Main top module integrating all components |
| `vga_controller.v`       | Generates sync signals and handles display timings |
| `cursor_control.v`       | Controls cursor position and movement |
| `color_select.v`         | Maps 16 switches to RGB color outputs |
| `frame_buffer.v`         | Holds pixel data to be displayed on screen |
| `constraints.xdc`        | **Nexys A7 specific** constraints file |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

1. Open **Vivado** and create a new project.
2. Add all Verilog files and the constraint file (`constraints.xdc`).
3. Make sure the FPGA board selected is **Nexys A7 (Artix-7)**.
4. Connect the **VGA monitor** to the board.
5. Synthesize, implement, and generate the bitstream.
6. Program the FPGA board using Vivado hardware manager.
7. Start painting with switches and buttons!

## üìå Additional Notes

- You can expand this project to support **shapes**, **line drawing**, or **mouse input**.
- The color output can be fine-tuned using 3-bit per channel (RGB) logic for more colors.
- Frame memory can be stored in **Block RAM** for larger resolutions or shapes.
